# concerning the reusability of the code from [original project](https://github.com/Shumzi/Connect-4-Elephant-Robotics-Legacy)

1. Board.py: other than some irrlevant quirks, should be ok. might need to read a bit more about the ai to understand if we need to edit it or not.
2. ArmInterface - might just take out the relevant functions and throw out the rest.
3. Arduino stuff - need to use what Dekel and Max did, just need to organize it.
4. ai code - was based on some ai model that's irrelevent. Just reimplement from scratch/some os repo.
